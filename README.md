👋 Hello! I'm founder of @hackclubnmit and love building softwares, automating my workflows, self-hosting all my services on personal servers (mostly on custom build Raspberry Pi clusters with ICE Tower Cooler🥶), developing algo-trading scripts, managing my entire life on Notion and reading a lot of newsletters on system design choices of big techs. From design to development I love the entire process of building software. I focus on maintainability, performance, and security with all of my projects and try to follow a lot of best practices. Following best practices early on is the way to go and I'm a huge supporter of it.




I'm a software engineer







I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural GitHub Star 🌟 based on my involvement in the tech community. My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch React Robins, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.

 I typically blog here on dev.to if I'm in a bloggy mood. You can also ask me anything (within reason).


I love working with the developer community on a global scale, building cool demo's, writing technical articles, speaking at conferences

My passions are open-source, growing communities, and building products that people love.

Working on open-source is my great joy in life and I want to be able to do that as much and as long as I possible can. I hope you like what I work on and that some of it is useful to you.

 Thanks for visiting!









🌙 By night, I write tutorials on spacejelly.dev, I supplement that writing with videos on Youtube, stream on Twitch, and I'm an instructor at Egghead.io.
